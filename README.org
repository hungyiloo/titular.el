* titular.el ðŸ” 
Emacs has convenient functions for upcasing and downcasing, but why not title casing? This package provides just that.

** Installation
This package isn't on MELPA yet.

If you aren't using Doom Emacs, the easiest way is probably to use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] like this
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(titular :type git :host github :repo "hungyiloo/titular.el"))
#+end_src

If you *are* using Doom like me, put this snippet in your =packages.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! titular
  :recipe (:host github :repo "hungyiloo/titular.el"))
#+end_src

Then put this in your =config.el= somewhere:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! titular
  :commands (titlecase-region titlecase-dwim))
#+end_src

** Usage
~titlecase-dwim~ will title case the selection region, or the entire line if no region is selected.
~titlecase-region~ will strictly title case the selected region only.

** Bonus Doom + evil integration
Put this in your =config.el= somewhere:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(evil-define-operator my/evil-titlecase-operator (beg end)
  (interactive "<r>")
  (save-excursion
    (set-mark beg)
    (goto-char end)
    (titlecase-dwim)))

(after! evil
  (map! :nv "g`" #'my/evil-titlecase-operator))
#+end_src

Now in normal mode you can use =g``= to title case a whole line, or in visual mode =g`= to title case the actively selected region.

** Testing
Execute the bash script =test.sh=, which runs the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html][ERT]] tests defined in =titular-test.el=.
